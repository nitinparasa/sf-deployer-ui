# sf-deployer-ui

SF Deployer is a tool to handle deployments from within the IDE. This is similar to Change sets management that is available in the Salesforce platform

# Start?
Start simple by running yarn watch (or npm run watch, if you set up the project with npm). This will start the project with a local development server.

The source files are located in the src folder. All web components are within the src/modules folder. The folder hierarchy also represents the naming structure of the web components.

This tool is built with [LWC](https://lwc.dev).
